                                    Dan was born and raised in California's Central Valley and has been involved in church life since the 5th grade. Upon entering college, and feeling the call to share the joy of Christ with others, he pursued music and ministry. He graduated from Azusa Pacific University and has a Master's Degree in Music and one in Ministry from the same institution. He and his wife, Chris, of 40 years have served churches in Duarte, Monrovia, Sacramento, Redlands and since 1993 he has been a Senior Pastor in Riverside. In 2016 he had to leave the active ministry due to health reasons but is so thankful for this new season in life where he can share Jesus -- this time through the Warehouse.

                                    With over 40 years of counseling, ministry, and pastoral work, Dan has an excellent ability to show mercy and understanding in times of "why" or "frustration". He loves to journey with others through life, especially with those who want to explore the reality of God's grace in the midst of current situations. Whether that means building up new dreams and goals or re-building the old dreams, Dan is excited about the opportunity to walk along side you.
